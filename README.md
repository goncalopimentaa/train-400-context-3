# 🌟 train-400-context-3 - Learn How Language Models Work

## 🚀 Getting Started

Welcome to the **train-400-context-3** project! This application demonstrates, at a very small scale, how a language model is trained. Specifically, it focuses on a three-context model with an explicit transform stage. Whether you're curious about machine learning or looking for a way to understand language models better, you're in the right place.

## 🔍 Understanding the Model

This project uses a three-context model, meaning it takes three previous words to predict the next one. This setup allows the model to provide more relevant predictions based on context. Here’s a quick overview of how it works:

- **Input**: The model takes in three words.
- **Processing**: Using the softmax regression method, it calculates the probability of possible next words.
- **Output**: The model predicts the most likely next word based on the provided input.
